SignalR Demo
=============

[SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/) is an asynchronous signaling library for .NET that allows multi-user, real-time-updating HTML applications. I put together this demonstration to learn how to use it. The demonstration is a simple MVC web application that shows the server time in the web browser. The clock updates every second, as the server fires server-side events that are propogated to the client browser. 

Hopefully, this demo will introduce you to SignalR and give you some ideas. Happy coding!
